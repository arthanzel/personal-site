                state-of-the-art computing papers to be my daily reading.</p>
            <p>
                My technical expertise includes many things:
                <strong>machine learning and AI</strong>,
                <strong>NLP</strong>,
                <strong>decentralized systems</strong>,
                <strong>computer languages</strong>,
                <strong>web technologies</strong>,
                <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>,
                <strong>digital privacy</strong>,
                <strong>blockchains</strong>, and
                <strong>biological computation</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>I also studied biomedical science, in which time I led a genetic engineering research team and explored the nascent field of biological computation. Studying life sciences gave me a fresh new perspective on computing, for which I am most grateful.</p>
